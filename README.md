# Impact-of-Early-Vasopressor-Administration-on-Septic-Shock-Mortality
This project analyzes the causal impact of administering norepinephrine within one hour of septic shock onset on mortality using the MIMIC-IV dataset. Patients were stratified into treatment/control groups, balanced via propensity score matching, and evaluated with IPW and DoWhy to estimate treatment effects.
